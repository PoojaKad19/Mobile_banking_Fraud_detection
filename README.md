# Mobile_banking_Fraud_detection

Fraud detection is essential for companies to safeguard their customers' transactions and accounts by detecting fraud before or as it happens. 
The FBI reports that in 2022, elder fraud victims in the US lost an average of $35,101 each, resulting in a total loss of over $3 billion.
Fraud detection using machine learning requires less manual labour. As the amount of data and experience increases, the results of machine learning become more accurate.


### Goal:

The goal of this project is to predict if a mobile banking transaction was fraudulent or not.

### About Dataset:
Financial transactions are intrinsically private in nature and hence this leads to no publicly available datasets, specially in the emerging mobile money transactions domain.
Used dataset from Kaggle. It is synthetic dataset generated using the simulator called PaySim. 
This work is part of the research project ”Scalable resource-efficient systems for big data analytics” fundedby the Knowledge Foundation (grant: 20140032) in Sweden.

## EDA & Data Pre-processing

- Checked for missing values, and class imbalance in target feature.
- The data was imbalanced. Performed random under-sampling
- No missing values were mentioned as NaN but there are in fact missing details in account balances.
